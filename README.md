# Dice Roller Application

An experiment built mostly with AI, to generate a web-browser only application
using React and Typescript to allow you to roll various combinations of dice by
typing in a formula (like 1d8 + 4d6 + 1), save certain formulas as favourites
and maintain a history of your rolls.
